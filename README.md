# **PISCINE PRO AI / MACHINE LEARNING**

This is a short course organized by Hive Helsinki with the goal of introducing people to AI and machine learning. 
The work was carried out in google colab using python

## *Module 00*

This part is about visualizing data using python's pandas and seaborn library, and using simple linear regression via sklearn

## *Module 01*

This part is also about using linear regression, but this time, instead of using sklearn, it is implemented directly using the gradient descent algorithmm and cost function

## *Module 02*

This part was about multiple linear regression: we prepared and cleaned the data first, used some visualization methods to understand the data, and performed data augmentation(one-hot encoding).
For the preprocessing we split the data into testing and training data and applied Min-Max scaling.
The Model training was done using the sklearn library. We evaluated the model based on the R-squared score.
