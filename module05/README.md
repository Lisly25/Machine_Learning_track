# MODULE 05

In this module, we had a larger dataset, and had to reach a high accuracy, but with more tools at our disposal.

The dataset was about fradulent financial transactions.

We performed data balancing and scaling before model training.

The best results were reached by using XGBoost for model training, but LogisticRegression, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Decision Trees were also experimented with
