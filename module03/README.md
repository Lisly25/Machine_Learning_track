# PART II

## Module 02

In this module, we learned about binary classification with logistic regression.

We worked with a dataset about cancer data, and trained a model to predict the class of the cancer based on several numerical measurements.
Before the training, we explored the data, visualizing it with boxplots and heatmaps.

We used python's sklearn library to train our model.
After calculating the accuracy, we also generated a confusion matrix, and visualized the results on a heatmap.
